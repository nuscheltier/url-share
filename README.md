# URL Share

This is just a simple tool I wrote for sharing URLs in my private network at home. I use a Raspberry Pi 3 to host this tool and access it from around my network.  
At the moment it just comes in one flavor: PHP Front- and Backend. A JS Frontend and Node.JS Backend are planned but not yet realized.  
Please be aware that there are no accounts. Everyone who has access to the site can edit, delete or share.

## Requirements
PHP Backend:
 * PHP > 5.3
 * Apache Webserver
Frontend:
 * any Webbrowser should suffice
